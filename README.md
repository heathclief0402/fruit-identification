Research question:
Image classification problem has been one of the hottest topics in Artificial Intelligence. Since
humanity entered the 21st century, the development of technology including the internet, improvement of
physical cameras and data storage technology, caused the data size of images to grow rapidly. In order to
understand the content of these images, humans need Artificial Intelligence to process the image and filter
the most useful data instead of manual data processing. Because the need for Artificial Intelligence
preprocessing increases, people need strong AI which can not only process the data in seconds, but also
complete its mission accurately. In this project, I developed a convolutional neural network(CNN) to
solve image classification problems. In the same time, I also developed other models to do the same
problems and I compared their performance with CNN.

Project deployment:
I wrote my project on colab, if you find route problem, please try to upload it on colab and run.

Data set:
28-data: save data for training
test-file: save data for testing 

Jupyter notebooks:
